# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the application of **Linear Regression**, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to predict house prices based on the area of the house (in square feet). The model establishes a linear relationship between the independent variable (**area**) and the dependent variable (**price**).


## 🎯 Objective

* Understand the concept of **supervised learning**.
* Apply **linear regression** to a real-world dataset.
* Predict house prices for unseen data points.
* Interpret results and evaluate the effectiveness of the model.


## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains:

* **Area** (in square feet) → Independent variable
* **Price** (in currency) → Dependent variable

The goal is to use the given data to learn a linear relationship and make accurate predictions.


## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Load the dataset containing house area and corresponding prices.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the distribution of data and identify patterns.
3. **Model Training**: Fit a **Linear Regression** model to map the relationship between area and price.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict prices for new data points.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess how well the model generalizes using regression metrics and visualization.


## 📊 Key Concepts

* **Linear Regression**: A method to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between actual and predicted values.
* **Supervised Learning**: Training the model using labeled data (area → price).
* **Overfitting vs. Generalization**: Ensuring the model works well not only on training data but also on unseen data.


## 🚀 Future Scope

* Extend to **Multiple Linear Regression** using more features (bedrooms, location, amenities).
* Explore **non-linear models** for more complex relationships.
* Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
